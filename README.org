#+TITLE: Org-fc Extras

This is a collection of extensions and packages designed to be used in
combination with org-fc.

* org-fc-dict

While it is convenient to store dictionaries directly in org-mode
files to avoid manually typing in entries for new words you'd like to
learn and to allow offline usage, they have to be split up into
multiple smaller files so each individual file can be opened and
reviewed quickly.

With ~org-fc-dict~ you can define dictionaries by specifying a
directory these files are located in together with a lookup scheme.
The locations of individual words are then cached (under the
assumption that headings don't move between files) for quick lookup
from within Emacs.

Two lookup schemes are implemented, either using top-level headings
or a special ~KEY~ property so e.g. Russian words can be looked up
by typing in their transliteration.
